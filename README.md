This program is able to scrap a big amount of images from lightshot server

I did this just for the challenge, dont use this for illegal purpose !


1. Execute this program with python3.

2. The program will ask you the start code wich is in the format 2numbers:4letters example:
aa1111

3. Then he ask the amount of images (max9999)

3. At the first step the program will source all of the images and only after all the sourcing is done he will write the images in the /output.
